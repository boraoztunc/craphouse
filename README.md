🍞 Jam is an open source alternative to Clubhouse, Twitter Spaces and similar audio spaces.

With Jam you can create audio rooms that can be used for panel discussions, jam sessions, free flowing conversations, debates, theatre plays, musicals and more. The only limit is your imagination.

## Known Issues and Solutions

**📱 iPhone: audio output sometimes switches randomly between loudspeaker and earspeaker.**

Workaround: use bluetooth or cable headphones, this way audio will always go through the headphones.

**📱 iPhone & Android: when phone goes to sleep/lockscreen because of inactivity the microphone or sound output might stop working until you unlock the screen again**

Workaround: make sure you are using Jam in the standalone browser instead of within a webview

**Participants can hear me but I can not hear them**

When participants join a room on 🍞 Jam they start in the _audience_, you can add them to the stage by tapping on them and by tapping the `"invite to stage"` button

## Host Your Own Server

Hosting your own Jam server is easy.

### Minimum Requirements

To run your own Jam instance we recommend a minimum of 1 GB RAM and a 1GHz CPU.

e.g.: a Raspberry Pi (1+ GB RAM) or the smallest [Digital Ocean Basic Droplet (1 GB RAM)](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing/) or the smallest [Linode shared plan (1 GB RAM)](https://www.linode.com/pricing/) or [t2.micro (1 GB RAM) on Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/) should be enough to get started.

### Install

1. Install docker and docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
1. `git clone https://gitlab.com/jam-systems/jam.git`
1. `cd jam`
1. `git checkout stable`  
1. `cd deployment`
1. `cp .env.example .env`
1. `nano .env` set `JAM_HOST` to the domain you want Jam to be available (If you are deploying on AWS you need a domain you own pointing to your sever as letsencrypt does not issue certificates for `*.compute.amazonaws.com` domains)
1. In your DNS settings point `${JAM_HOST}`, and `*.${JAM_HOST}` to your IP address (if you don't want a wildcard you need the subdomains `stun` and `turn` (e.g. stun.jam.example.com and turn.jam.example.com))
1. If you are behind a NAT:
   1. Open ports 3478 and 3480, both TCP and UDP, and 80 and 443, TCP, on your firewall
   1. `nano turnserver.conf` set `realm` to your domain. If you are running coturn behind NAT, you may need to add the parameter  `external-ip` and give it the value of your public IP address.
1. `docker-compose up -d`

### Update

**NOTE:** Make sure you have the newest version of docker-compose (install according to https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

1. `cd jam/deployment`
2. `git checkout stable`
3. `git pull`
4. `docker-compose pull`
5. `docker-compose up -d`

**NOTE:** If you update from a version before March 23rd to one after and you want to keep users' identities and rooms:

1. `cd jam/deployment`
2. `docker-compose down`   
3. `git checkout stable`
4. `git pull`
5. `docker-compose pull`
6. `mv ../pantryredis ../data`   
7. `docker-compose up -d`

## Develop

In in the `ui` directory use `yarn` to install dependencies and `yarn start` to start the local development server.

Directory overview:

`deployment`/ docker compose file for deploying and hosting of Jam

`pantry`/ a lightweight server for handling authentication and coordination of Jam

`signalhub`/ a simple server for managing WebRTC connections for Jam

`ui`/ web based user interface based on the React framework
