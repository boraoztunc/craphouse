# jam-react

Jam is your own embeddable Clubhouse-style audio space. This package exposes Jam as a standalone React component.

```sh
yarn add jam-react
```

Usage:

```js
import Jam from 'jam-react';

<Jam roomId="new-jam-room" />
```

`<Jam>` supports three props:

* `roomId` - **required**, string, your room ID which also makes the room accessible by navigating to `https://jam.systems/<roomId>`.
* `jamUrl` - optional, string, URL of the jam instance. The default is `https://jam.systems` which you may use freely.
* `newRoom` - optional, `{name: string, description: string}`, to customize the room at the moment it is created. (Advanced options that will add way more customizations than the current UI are coming soon.)

Any other props, like `style`, are merged into the top-level `<iframe>` which loads jam. This allows you to add styling, customize `iframe` feature policy etc. Note that Jam needs `allow="microphone"` to work.

Here is a full example for rendering three audio rooms on one page:

```js
import React from 'react';
import Jam from 'jam-react';

function App() {
  let ids = ['01', '02', '03'];
  return (
    <div style={{padding: '1rem'}}>
      <h1>Jam: My own Clubhouse!!!!</h1>
      <div>
        {ids.map(id => (
          <Jam
            key={id}
            roomId={`new-jam-room-${id}`}
            newRoom={{
              name: 'A new Jam Room',
              description: 'This Room was created by a React component',
              color: '#000000',
            }}
            style={{width: '400px', height: '600px'}}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
